# Work-Day-Scheduler

**Main objective**
Create a daily planner that a user can write events in during business hours. When the user opens the app, they are able to see the current date in the header. User can see timeblocks between the hours of 9AM-5PM that are color coded in past, present, and future colors (grey, red, and green). When the user wants to write down an event for a certain time, they can enter that information in the description box. Once the user presses the save button, that information is saved and will be saved even if the user refreshes the page.

**Additional Notes**
At the time I finished this challenge it was already past the hours of 9am-5pm, so I was able to add additional time blocks to test that the color coding was working properly. Removed those blocks so app appeared as it should for the acceptance criteria. I hope it continues to work during the normal business hours! Otherwise, I felt fairly confident about setting this up- it was a great project to practice and improve my comfort level with JS.
